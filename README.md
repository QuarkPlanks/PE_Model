# PE_Model
A model that could predict branch degree and conversion of PE and design process parameters.

## Model Usage
### Model Training
* 1. Prepare data and save the data in corresponding .xlsx files or use the data already prepared.
* 2. Run 'BD-Model.py' to train a BD predicting model.
* 3. Run 'Conversion-Model.py' to train a Conversion predicting model.
* 4. Models will be saved in 'model' folder.
### Parameter Design
* 1. Set desired branch degree in 'Designer.py'.
* 2. Decide whether to display results or not.
* 3. Decide whether to search for best starting point or not.
* 4. Run 'Designer.py' and get the design result.
